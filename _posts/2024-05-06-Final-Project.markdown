            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In late March of 2020, a significant shift was made to the everyday lives of people across the world. The spread of Covid-19 was in it's early stages, but still spreading at a rapid rate. Many countries decided to implement a series of actions in order to prevent any further infection, and one of the most widely used preventative actions was that of isolation. This was because of the nature of how the virus was able to spread from person to person. Therefore, states were issuing different social distancing actions, also known as stay-at-home orders. This meant that governments required all individuals to stay at home, with the exception of essential activities, essential government functions and essential businesses and operations, meaning that all non-essential business and operations must cease (source: https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/coronavirus/Resources/Pages/ExecutiveOrders)
                <br>
                However, with these stay-at-home orders being issued across different states, a growing concern was also raised by researchers and victim service providers regarding a potential increase in the amount and/or severity of domestic violence cases (source: https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/a-short-term-analysis-of-domestic-violence-and-sexual-assault-victim-services-following-the-illinois-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/). 
                <br>
                So, with this dichotomy in mind, the article will set out to investigate the impact that the nation-wide "stay-at-home" order had on the development of domestic violence related crimes in Chicago. It will have its main focus on Chicago in the state of Illinois, as the estimate of domestic violence towards men (1 in 4, or 25.9%) and women (1 in 3, or 41.5%) were on the higher end of the spectrum, when comparing with the general trend in the U.S (sources: https://ncadv.org/state-by-state and https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/domestic-violence-by-state).
