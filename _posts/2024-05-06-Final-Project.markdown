            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In late March of 2020, a significant shift was made to the everyday lives of people across the world. The spread of Covid-19 was in it's early stages, but still spreading at a rapid rate. Many countries decided to implement a series of actions in order to prevent any further infection, and one of the most widely used preventative actions was that of isolation. This was because of the nature of how the virus was able to spread from person to person. Therefore, states were issuing different social distancing actions, also known as stay-at-home orders. This meant that governments required all individuals to stay at home, with the exception of essential activities, essential government functions and essential businesses and operations, meaning that all non-essential business and operations must cease (source: https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/coronavirus/Resources/Pages/ExecutiveOrders)
                <br>
                However, with these stay-at-home orders being issued across different states, a growing concern was also raised by researchers and victim service providers regarding a potential increase in the amount and/or severity of domestic violence cases (source: https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/a-short-term-analysis-of-domestic-violence-and-sexual-assault-victim-services-following-the-illinois-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/). 
                <br>
                So, with this dichotomy in mind, the article will set out to investigate the impact that the nation-wide "stay-at-home" order had on the development of domestic violence related crimes in Chicago. It will have its main focus on Chicago in the state of Illinois, as the estimate of domestic violence towards men (1 in 4, or 25.9%) and women (1 in 3, or 41.5%) were on the higher end of the spectrum, when comparing with the general trend in the U.S (sources: https://ncadv.org/state-by-state and https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/domestic-violence-by-state).

            <h3>Relevant Facts</h3>
            <h4>What is domestic violence?</h4>
            <p cite="https://www.womenslaw.org/laws/il/restraining-orders/orders-protection/basic-info/what-legal-definition-domestic-violence">

                    <br>
                    The definition for what makes a crime specifically constitute as a crime of domestic violence, is when the aggressor and the victim of the crime are either family or members of the same household (source: https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/domestic-violence/domestic-violence-illinois-penalties-defense).

            <h4>What is the meaning of a "stay-at-home" order in Illinois?</h4>
            <p>
                These types of orders have different meanings across different states in the U.S. Specifically in Illinois, it is defined as such:
                <br>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.illinois.gov/government/executive-orders/executive-order.executive-order-number-10.2020.html">
                STAY AT HOME — All individuals must stay at home, with exceptions for essential activities, essential government functions, and essential businesses and operations. All non-essential business and operations must cease, aside from Minimum Basic Operations. Business can continue with employees working from home.

               <p>
Figure (x) shows the monthly data from January to December in 2020, divided between the Sides of Chicago (SOURCE:https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chicago_community_areas_map.svg#/media/File:Chicago_community_areas_map.svg ), with a look at comparing it to the same timeperiod in 2019.
<br>
Generally, there does not seem to be a large deviation from January to March, although there are some small jumps in the Domestic abuse counts. 
All of the Sides end up having a slight decline in March of 2020 comparatively; The only exception here is the Central side, which ends with a slight increase.
<br><br>
From April to June however, 3 trends seem to be observed in the data.
The first trend can be exemplified by observing the south-grouped sides, which reveals a initial significant jump in comparative decline for the month of April 2020.
The decline is slightly lessened by May, and then largely tapered off by June.
The only exception is Far Southwest side, which starts off with a rather large decline of -0.40 % in April comparatively, but falls down just as quickly the next month, ending in June 2020 with an tapered off decline of -0.25%.
The general south-grouped trend seems to hold true for West Side and Far Noth Side as well. 
<br>
The second trend is seen in the North Side and Northwest Side; Almost no decline is observed in April 2020, then a sudden sharp decline in May, which already wears off in June, bringing them largely back to baseline.
<br>
The final third trend hold true for the Central Side only, which has an initial significant decline at -0.32% in April 2020, declining steadily by an additional -0.10% in May, and again in June.
This is the only side which ends June 2020 with an significant difference comparatively to 2019.
<br><br>
The data from July to December 2020 for the Sides is observed to contain much more variance than before, with no immediate pattern emerging. Some of the Sides, such as Southwest side, deviate significantly for a single monthly period, before returning to baseline the following month(s).The sides generally end December with a decline between -0.10% and -0.30%.
The only exceptions here is  South side, which ends at a near 0% difference, and the Central side and North Side, which deviate rather largely negatively and positively, respectively.
 <br><br>

It seems that April through June is the timeperiod with the most pattern like deviation, with the Domestic Abuse counts of some Sides changing different than others.
