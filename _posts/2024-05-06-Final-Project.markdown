            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In late March of 2020, a significant shift was made to the everyday lives of people across the world. The spread of Covid-19 was in it's early stages, but still spreading at a rapid rate. Many countries decided to implement a series of actions in order to prevent any further infection, and one of the most widely used preventative actions was that of isolation. This was because of the nature of how the virus was able to spread from person to person. Therefore, states were issuing different social distancing actions, also known as stay-at-home orders. This meant that governments required all individuals to stay at home, with the exception of essential activities, essential government functions and essential businesses and operations, meaning that all non-essential business and operations must cease (source: https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/coronavirus/Resources/Pages/ExecutiveOrders)
                <br>
                However, with these stay-at-home orders being issued across different states, a growing concern was also raised by researchers and victim service providers regarding a potential increase in the amount and/or severity of domestic violence cases (source: https://icjia.illinois.gov/researchhub/articles/a-short-term-analysis-of-domestic-violence-and-sexual-assault-victim-services-following-the-illinois-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/). 
                <br>
                So, with this dichotomy in mind, the article will set out to investigate the impact that the nation-wide "stay-at-home" order had on the development of domestic violence related crimes in Chicago. It will have its main focus on Chicago in the state of Illinois, as the estimate of domestic violence towards men (1 in 4, or 25.9%) and women (1 in 3, or 41.5%) were on the higher end of the spectrum, when comparing with the general trend in the U.S (sources: https://ncadv.org/state-by-state and https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/domestic-violence-by-state).

            <h3>Relevant Facts</h3>
            <h4>What is domestic violence?</h4>
            <p cite="https://www.womenslaw.org/laws/il/restraining-orders/orders-protection/basic-info/what-legal-definition-domestic-violence">
                    Domestic violence in the state of Illinois includes the following; (1) Physical abuse, (2) Harassment, (3) Intimidation of a dependent person, (4) Interference with personal liberty and (5) Willful deprivation.
                    <br>
                    The definition for what makes a crime specifically constitute as a crime of domestic violence, is when the aggressor and the victim of the crime are either family or members of the same household (source: https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/domestic-violence/domestic-violence-illinois-penalties-defense).

            <h4>What is the meaning of a "stay-at-home" order in Illinois?</h4>
            <p>
                These types of orders have different meanings across different states in the U.S. Specifically in Illinois, it is defined as such:
                <br>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.illinois.gov/government/executive-orders/executive-order.executive-order-number-10.2020.html">
                STAY AT HOME — All individuals must stay at home, with exceptions for essential activities, essential government functions, and essential businesses and operations. All non-essential business and operations must cease, aside from Minimum Basic Operations. Business can continue with employees working from home. Local government units across the state must halt all evictions, and gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited.
                </blockquote>

                Investigating figure (prior)'s data, but by the sides of chicago, reveals further insight.

                Generally, there does not seem to be a large deviation from january to march in 2020, when comparing the frequencies and percent difference of domestic abuse to the same month and side in 2019.
                Some sides, such as Southwest side and West side, start january 2020 off by having nearly the same frequency as in 2019. 
                Others, such as North side and Northwest side, have a larger january deviation comparatively, at a near +- 0.20 %.
                All of them in general end up having a slight decline in March 2020; The only exception here is the Central side, which ends with a slight increase.
                All the sides are observed to have some variation from month to month in this period, which makes it hard to discern whether there is any pattern to the differences.


                3 trends seem to be observed in the data, when comparing the frequencies for the sides from April to June, between the 2 years.
                The first trend can be exemplified by observing the south-grouped sides, which reveals a initial significant jump in decline for the month of April 2020;
                However, the decline seems to be sustained or slightly lessened by May, and then largely tapered off by June, as these areas end up with near- or slightly worse frequency compared to April of 2019.
                The only exception is Far Southwest side, which starts off with a rather large decline of -0.40 % in April comparatively, but falls down just as quickly the next month, ending in June 2020 with an tapered off decline of -0.25%.
                The general south-grouped trend seems to hold true for West Side and Far Noth Side as well. 

                The second trend is seen in the North Side and Northwest Side; Almost no decline is observed in April 2020, then a sudden jump in decline in May, which already wears off in June, bringing them largely back to their april baseline.

                The final third trend hold true for the Central Side only, which has an initial significant decline at -0.32% in April 2020, declining steadily by an additional -0.10% in May, and again in June.
                This is the only side which ends June 2020 with an significant difference comparatively to 2019.

                The data from July to December 2020 for the Sides is observed to contain much more variance than before, with no immediate pattern emerging.
                As an example, the frequence of the Central side returns to near the same number for June 2020, as in 2019. From that point on, ontowards December, the frequencies vary but are largely sustaned comparetively to 2019, until a smaller jump in decline in December.
                Other sides seem to also behave "erraticly", such as the Southwest side, which largely sustains a frequency close to baseline initially, suddenly deviates significantly in September, and then goes back to baseline the following months.
                The sides generally end with a decline between -0.10% and -0.30%.
                The only exceptions here are South side, which ends at a near 0% difference, and the Central side and North Side, which deviate rather largely negatively and positively, respectively.
